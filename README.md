# Financial-Crime-Detection-or-Sanctions-Screening-Monitoring-ML

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive framework for monitoring the performance, data quality, and operational health of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Machine Learning models deployed in a production environment. The primary objective of this framework is to ensure the continuous effectiveness, stability, and regulatory compliance of critical financial crime detection models, including those used for Sanctions Screening, Transaction Monitoring, and Integrated Risk Scoring.

In the dynamic landscape of financial crime, ML models can degrade over time due to shifts in data distributions, changes in criminal methodologies, or evolving regulatory requirements. This monitoring plan provides a structured approach to detect such degradation proactively, mitigate risks, and maintain the integrity and accuracy of our AML systems.

## Project Scope & Objectives

This project aims to:
* Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for AML ML models.
* Establish methodologies for detecting data drift, concept drift, and model performance degradation.
* Outline procedures for automated alerting and incident management.
* Provide a clear framework for model re-validation and retraining cycles.
* Ensure auditability and regulatory compliance of ML model operations.
* Document the monitoring strategy for various AML model types (e.g., Anomaly Detection, Classification, Risk Scoring).

## Key Features & Components

This repository includes documentation and potentially code/configuration for the following aspects of the AML ML Model Monitoring Framework:

1.  **Model Inventory & Registry Integration**: Details on how monitored models are registered and tracked.
2.  **Performance Monitoring**:
    * **KPIs Defined**: Documentation of specific metrics for model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN), and alert volume specific to AML.
    * **Thresholds & Baselines**: Definition of acceptable performance ranges and deviation thresholds.
3.  **Data Quality Monitoring**:
    * **Input Data Validation**: Checks for completeness, accuracy, consistency, and format of incoming data streams.
    * **Feature Distribution Drift Detection**: Monitoring for changes in key feature distributions over time (e.g., using statistical tests like KS-test, Wasserstein distance).
4.  **Concept Drift Detection**: Methodologies to identify shifts in the underlying relationship between input features and target variables, indicating changes in criminal behavior or transaction patterns.
5.  **Operational Monitoring**:
    * **Latency & Throughput**: Monitoring model inference time and processing capacity.
    * **System Health**: Integration with infrastructure monitoring tools.
6.  **Alerting & Notification System**:
    * **Triggering Mechanisms**: How deviations from baselines or thresholds generate alerts.
    * **Alert Escalation Matrix**: Defined pathways for different severity levels.
    * **Communication Channels**: Integration with notification systems (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty).
7.  **Diagnostic & Remediation Playbooks**:
    * **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Guidance**: Steps to diagnose detected issues.
    * **Remediation Strategies**: Procedures for model retraining, data pipeline adjustments, or model redeployment.
8.  **Reporting & Dashboards**: Specifications for visualizations and reports that provide a holistic view of model health (e.g., using tools like Grafana, Kibana, Tableau).
9.  **Audit Trail & Governance**: Mechanisms for logging monitoring activities and decisions for regulatory compliance.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to logically separate different aspects of the monitoring plan:
